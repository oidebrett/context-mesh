# Notes on Deep Links
# ============================================
# 
# Google Drive: Deep links are automatically generated from the API response (webViewLink)
# OneDrive: Deep links are automatically generated from the API response (webUrl)
# GitHub: Deep links are automatically generated from the API response (html_url)
# Google Calendar: Deep links are automatically generated from the API response (htmlLink)
# Slack: No deep links available (Slack doesn't provide direct user URLs)
#
# For CRM systems (Zoho, Salesforce), you need to configure the base URL/domain
# because the API doesn't always return the full web URL for records.
