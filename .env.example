# ============================================
# These environment variables enable deep links back to the original platform
# for synced records. Configure only the providers you're using.

# Zoho CRM Configuration
# Required for generating deep links to Zoho CRM records
# Example: https://crm.zoho.eu/crm/org20110177769/tab/Accounts/912177000000513868
ZOHO_CRM_DOMAIN="eu"  # Options: com, eu, in, com.au, jp, etc.
ZOHO_CRM_ORG_ID="org20110177769"  # Find this in your Zoho CRM URL

# Salesforce Configuration
# Required for generating deep links to Salesforce records
# Example: https://yourcompany.my.salesforce.com/0015g00000ABCDEF
SALESFORCE_INSTANCE_URL="https://yourcompany.my.salesforce.com"  # Your Salesforce instance URL (no trailing slash)

# ============================================
# Notes on Deep Links
# ============================================
# 
# Google Drive: Deep links are automatically generated from the API response (webViewLink)
# OneDrive: Deep links are automatically generated from the API response (webUrl)
# GitHub: Deep links are automatically generated from the API response (html_url)
# Google Calendar: Deep links are automatically generated from the API response (htmlLink)
# Slack: No deep links available (Slack doesn't provide direct user URLs)
#
# For CRM systems (Zoho, Salesforce), you need to configure the base URL/domain
# because the API doesn't always return the full web URL for records.
